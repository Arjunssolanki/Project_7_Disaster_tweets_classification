# Project_7_Disaster_tweets_classification
Build a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying tweets as either related to real disasters or not
=======
# Objectives:
●	Classification Model Development: Develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not.
●	Accuracy and Precision: Aim for high accuracy and precision in classification to minimize false alarms and ensure timely and accurate disaster detection.
●	Robustness: Create a model that can handle variations in language, including slang, abbreviations, and cultural nuances, to ensure effectiveness across diverse tweet datasets.
●	Scalability: Build a scalable solution capable of processing large volumes of tweets in real-time to support continuous monitoring efforts.
